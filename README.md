- Hi, I’m Briana!
- I’m interested in animation and pursuing a career in Production Engineering.
- I’m currently learning relational data modeling, computer graphics, virtual memory, animation, and more.

If you would like to see the work I am doing at the University of Victoria, please navigate to /school-work. 
Unfortunately I cannot show the work from my previous internship as this is confidential information.
